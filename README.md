<h1>Mandelbrot & Buddhabrot Generator</h1>
MandelbrotApp is a Kotlin Android application that visualizes fractals, including the classic Mandelbrot Set and the fascinating Buddhabrot. <br>
The app renders fractals using mathematical precision and allows different color schemes and sampling resolutions for high-quality images.

<h1>üß† Features</h1>
Mandelbrot Set: Black-and-white or colored rendering using iteration-based weighting.<br>
Buddhabrot Visualization: High-resolution images with enhanced statistical sampling.<br>
Color Modes: Supports log, simple, and gamma weighting to control brightness distribution.<br>
Custom Sampling Factor: Fine-grained control over the number of complex points per pixel.<br>
Optimized Core: Heavy computation offloaded to background thread via Dispatchers.Default.<br>

<h1>üß∞ Technologies </h1>
Kotlin (100%)<br>
Android Jetpack Compose<br>
Bitmap.createBitmap for image generation<br>
Coroutine-based background processing (lifecycleScope, Dispatchers)<br>
Mathematical engine built from scratch (no external libraries)<br>

<h1>üìç Fractal Parameters</h1>
Complex plane range: [-1.5, -1.0] to [0.8, 1.0]<br>
Resolution: adjustable (width x height)<br>
Iterations: configurable (e.g., 20,000 for high quality)<br>
Buddha sampling factor: configurable (e.g., 5x5 per pixel)<br>

<h1>üß™ How to Run via Command Line (Windows)</h1>
Open the powershell terminal.<br>
Compile the file .kt (which contains the main function):<br>
<b>kotlinc Main.kt -include-runtime -d MandelbrotApp.jar</b>

and then run:<br>
<b>java -jar MandelbrotApp.jar</b>

üñºÔ∏è This will save the .png images directly to the configured folder (e.g., C:\Users\Alan\Desktop\), with filenames formatted by type of calculation, color, and method.<br>

<h1>üìÇ Output</h1>
Mandelbrot (black-and-white)<br>
Mandelbrot (logarithmic, gamma, simple)<br>
Buddhabrot (logarithmic, gamma, simple)<br>
Each image exported with the naming pattern:<br>
Mandelbrot_{mode}_{foregroundColor}_{backgroundColor}.png<br>
Buddha_{mode}_{foregroundColor}_{backgroundColor}.png<br>

And you can also run on the mobile which is the main application.
